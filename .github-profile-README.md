## What We Do

We help small and mid-sized businesses access the same caliber of security, infrastructure, and AI expertise that enterprises take for granted — without the enterprise price tag.

### 🛡️ Virtual CISO & Information Security
Security leadership on flexible retainers. Compliance programs (SOC2, FINRA, SEC, SOX), threat modeling, vulnerability management, and executive-ready reporting.

### ⚡ Virtual DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering
Fractional engineering leadership for CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, observability, and reliability programs. Migrated 280+ services to Kubernetes. Reduced monthly alerts from 1,000+ to under 50.

### 💰 FinOps & Cloud Cost Optimization
Evaluate deployments for real cost savings. Right-size resources, optimize reserved instances, and implement FinOps practices. **Our guarantee:** If we don't save you more than our billable hours, you don't pay.

### 🤖 AI Enablement
Cut through the AI hype. We help you identify practical AI tools and workflows that actually accelerate your business — without the confusion or wasted spend.

## Why Secunit Mercantile?

Most small businesses don't need more tools or junior consultants — they need experienced guidance from people who've actually built and operated production systems at scale.

- **20+ years** of combined experience
- **CISSP certified** (since 2017)
- **Senior expertise, always** — you'll never be handed off to junior staff
- **Flexible retainers** tailored to your needs, not one-size-fits-all packages
- **Enterprise-grade outcomes** at costs that make sense for growing businesses

Our team has led cloud migrations, built SOC2-aligned security programs, and helped organizations adopt DevOps and SRE practices that reduced outages, cut costs, and accelerated delivery.
